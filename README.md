# README

This is a simple demo java implementation of a Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph.

## How to run

* Look at Main.java for the main method

## IMPORTANT

Note that this is Dijkstra implementation for start to end **WITHOUT** waypoint!

You need think of how to implement the waypoint part
